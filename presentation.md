Problem definition (I)
========================================================

Student dropout in Higher Education institutions is a primary concern

- Economic loss for institution
- Economic loss for the student
- Lost opportunity for society

Problem definition (II)
========================================================

In distance learning, 30% or even 40% dropout rates are common.

A dropout prediction system could aid these institution to develop early, focused, effective retention actions.  

But, what could be the potential ROI?

Business case
========================================================

A sound business case must be provided in order to help decision makers understand:  
- The expected costs of a predictive system
- The expected benefits
- The parameters that will affect both quantities
- The expected ROI

The ROI Calculator App has been created to automate the neccesary calculations.

Example
=========================================================
The output of the calculator is expressed in textual form to help business users understand it. This is a real example output:  

```
[1] "From  2696 enrolled students,  809  would dropout the next year. The system would generate  943  dropout risk alerts, 566  would be true alerts, and  377  would be false alarms.  943  retention actions would be triggered, with a total cost of  4715  €. As a result,  28  students would be retained, generating next year a gross revenue of  55470.07  € and a net income of  35755.07  € (that is: after substracting the cost of retention actions ant the cost of the predictive system)."
```
